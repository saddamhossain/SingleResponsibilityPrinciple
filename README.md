# SOLID Principles

**SOLID** principles are the software design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. SOLID is a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, in the early 2000s.

**SOLID** is an acronym where:

- **S** stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** stands for Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** stands for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** stands for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

In this repository, we embrace the **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**. This is what SRP means:

- Every method/class has only one responsibility.
- Every method/class must do only one thing.
- Every method/class should have only one reason to change.

The **Single Responsibility Principle** can guide the design of various components to ensure they have clear, focused responsibilities. By separating concerns appropriately, we can create more maintainable, flexible, and understandable code. Sometimes, combining related behaviors into a single interface or class can be reasonable if they are closely related and likely to change for similar reasons.
