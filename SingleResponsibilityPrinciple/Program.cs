/*
  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
 This is what SRP means:
 -> Every method / class have only one responsibility.
 -> Every method / class must do only one thing.
 -> Every method / class should have only one reason to change.
*/


/*
Note: To facilitate a clear understanding of the SRP, I've named the class library in a way that allows us to easily identify and comprehend its
contents by simply looking at the name of the file. Same for the method return type.
*/


/*
Single Responsibility Principle can guide the design of various components to ensure they have clear, focused responsibilities.
By separating concerns appropriately, we can create more maintainable, flexible, and understandable code.
Sometimes, combining related behaviors into a single interface or class can be reasonable if they are closely related and likely to change for similar reasons.
